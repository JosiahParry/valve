Description: Scales Plumber APIs in parallel on demand. Valve is a Rust library, 
  cli tool, and R package, that spawns plumber APIs in parallel. Valve creates a 
  connection pool of Plumber APIs which are fetched based on availability. Unused
  connections are terminated. Valve is built using the powerful extendr, tokio,
  and deadpool libraries.
