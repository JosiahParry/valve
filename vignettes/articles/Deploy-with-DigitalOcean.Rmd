```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

1. Create an account on DigitalOcean
1. Open the Docker desktop app
2. Create a Docker image
3. build & tag docker image
4. push image to dockerhub
5. navigate to console
6. apps > new 
7. dockerhub & fill in values


## Building Docker Image

Start by building and tagging a Docker image. 

Follow the below format 

```shell
docker build -t ${USERNAME}/${IMAGE}:${VERSION} .
docker tag ${USERNAME}/${IMAGE}:${VERSION} ${USERNAME}/${IMAGE}:latest
```

In my case I ran: 

```shell
docker build -t josiahparry/valve:stable .
docker tag josiahparry/valve:stable valve:latest
```

Open Docker Desktop.
Sign into Docker desktop by pressing `Sign In` in the top right.
You can now push to DockerHub from the app. Find the image you build in the images section. Click the three dots for more menu options. 


Note that if youre using a Mac ARM machine (M1, M2, etc) you'll need to build with amd64

```shell    
docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 -t josiahparry/valve:latest .
```
